# Todo-App in React
The purpose of this React-app is to allow the user to create todos, set a deadline for them and have all the created todos displayed within a neat and clear structure. Additionally, the user can edit and delete each of the created tasks and deadlines.

I wrote the app in TypeScript. The styling was done with Tailwind CSS.

# Usage
To run the project: npm (run) start.
